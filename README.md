# Design Patterns in JAVA

These design patterns are from [O'Reilly Head First Design Patterns (E2)](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Design+Patterns&qid=1611797725&sr=8-1)

This repo is meant to serve as a simple reference to these fundamental design patterns. Most examples are 
pretty close to the book.

Most use case examples are in the `Main.java` file as static methods.
